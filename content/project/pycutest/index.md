[PyCUTEst](https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest) is a Python wrapper for [CUTEst](https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst), a Fortran package for testing (nonlinear) optimization software. More details are available in the [documentation](https://jfowkes.github.io/pycutest).

PyCUTEst is based on the CUTEr wrapper by [Arpad Buermen](http://fides.fe.uni-lj.si/~arpadb/software-pycuter.html) and developed jointly with [Jaroslav Fowkes](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/fowkes).

Please cite PyCUTEst by citing the associated [summary paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04377).
