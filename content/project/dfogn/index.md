[DFO-GN](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfogn) is a Python library for solving nonlinear least-squares problems, with optional box constraints.
[DFO-LS] (https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols) is a newer version of this package with more features. The documentation for DFO-GN is [here](https://numericalalgorithmsgroup.github.io/dfogn).
