[Py-BOBYQA](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/pybobyqa) is a Python implementation of [Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._D._Powell)'s BOBYQA (original [paper](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/na/NA_papers/NA2009_06.pdf) and [code](http://mat.uc.pt/~zhang/software.html)). It is a derivative-free solver for general objective minimization, with optional bound constraints.

It also includes a number of features originally from [DFO-LS](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols), which improve its flexibility and robustness to noise. The documentation for Py-BOBYQA is [here](https://numericalalgorithmsgroup.github.io/pybobyqa).

A version of Py-BOBYQA is also available in the commercial [NAG Library](https://www.nag.co.uk/content/nag-library).
