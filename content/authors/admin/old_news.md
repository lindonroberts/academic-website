- (Jul-21) Interviewed by Channel 9 National News about projections for Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout: [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CHHjuBWOXs)
- (Jun-21) Delighted to be announced as the first prize winner of the [20th IMA Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis](https://ima.org.uk/awards-medals/ima-leslie-fox-prize-numerical-analysis/) for my recent paper on [scalable DFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016)! Watch the video of my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS2QBTwR8-4).
- (Jun-21) New paper submitted, *Does Model Calibration Reduce Uncertainty in Climate Projections?*, led by [Simon Tett](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-tett) (University of Edinburgh). The study shows that performing structured parameter tuning of climate models helps to significantly reduce the uncertainties in their predictions. It also shows that my [DFO-LS](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols) code is an effective solver for parameter fitting of climate models. Preprint coming soon!
