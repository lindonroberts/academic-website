**News:**

- (Jun-20) New paper *Scalable Derivative-Free Optimization for Nonlinear Least-Squares Problems* with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) and Tyler Ferguson (Oxford) has been accepted for the ICML workshop [Beyond First-Order Methods in ML Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/optml-icml2020/accepted-papers).
- (Jun-20) New paper [Inexact Derivative-Free Optimization for Bilevel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12674) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath)! We introduce a new algorithm for learning variational regularization parameters, applicable to problems such as image denoising and MRI reconstruction.
- (May-20) My [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page is now public. This has been built over several years with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) and [Jaroslav Fowkes](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/fowkes/) (University of Oxford).
- (Apr-20) I will be (virtually) presenting at the [UNSW Applied Mathematics Seminar](https://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/seminars/2020-04/derivative-free-optimisation-least-squares-problems). It will be recorded, so email me if you want to watch the recording.
- (Feb-20) My paper *A derivative-free Gauss-Newton method* has been awarded the best paper of 2019 for the journal *Mathematical Programming Computation*!

- (Jan-20) I will be attending the [Mathematics in Industry Study Group](https://mathsinindustry.com/) at the University of Newcastle.
- (Dec-19) I will be presenting at the first [Data Science Down Under](https://carma.newcastle.edu.au/meetings/dsdu/) workshop at the University of Newcastle.
- (Nov-19) I will be an invited speaker at ANU's [Uncertainty Quantification workshop](https://maths.anu.edu.au/news-events/events/uncertainty-quantification-workshop).
