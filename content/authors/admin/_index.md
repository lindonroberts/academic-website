I am a lecturer and [ARC DECRA Fellow](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/funding-schemes/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra) at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/), University of Sydney. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 
I am also an Associate Investigator for [OPTIMA](https://optima.org.au/).

**In July 2025, I will be joining the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne as a Senior Lecturer in Data Science.**

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.
