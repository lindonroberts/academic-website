I am a lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.

**Recent news:**

- (Dec-23) I am a co-organiser of the joint [WOMBAT/WICO workshops](https://wombat.mocao.org/) on optimisation and computational maths, 11-15 December at the University of Sydney. 
- (Nov-23) Our paper [*Analyzing Inexact Hypergradients for Bilevel Learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04764) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) has been accepted by IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics. Link to follow soon.
- (Oct-23) I will be an invited speaker at the first [SigmaOpt workshop](https://www.mathematics.org.au/sys/pages/plain.php?page_id=25&conf_id=61) associated with the ANZIAM meeting in February 2024. I am also on the judging panel for the best student paper prize which will be awarded at the workshop. 
- (Oct-23) I gave a One School seminar (i.e. school colloquium) for the USyd School of Mathematics and Statistics.
- (Sep-23) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at the [Simons Collaboration on Hidden Symmetries and Fusion Energy](https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu/meetings/simons-hour-talks).
- (Aug-23) Very excited to receive an [ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/funding-schemes/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra) (2024-2026). See a short project description on the [ARC page of all funded projects](https://rms.arc.gov.au/RMS/Report/Download/Report/1b0c8b2e-7bb0-4f2d-8f52-ad207cfbb41d/252) or the [university news item](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2023/08/28/early-career-researchers-awarded-5-1m-funding.html).
- (Aug-23) New paper [*Dynamic Bilevel Learning with Inexact Line Search*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10098) with [Mohammad Sadegh Salehi](https://mohammadsadeghsalehi.github.io/), [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) and [Subhadip Mukherjee](https://sites.google.com/view/subhadip-mukherjee/home) (IIT Kharagpur). We introduce a linesearch algorithm suitable for bilevel learning based on conntrollable accuracy function and (hyper)gradient evaluations.
- (Aug-23) New paper [*Expected decrease for derivative-free algorithms using random subspaces*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04734) with [Warren Hare](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/warren-hare/) (University of British Columbia) and [Clément Royer](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~croyer/) (Université Paris Dauphine-PSL). We study why random subspace methods work best with very low-dimensional subspaces.
- (Aug-23) Our paper [*Direct search based on probabilistic descent in reduced spaces*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01275) with [Clément Royer](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~croyer/) (Université Paris Dauphine-PSL) has been accepted by SIAM Journal on Optimization. Link to follow soon. 
- (Jul-23) Our paper [*Mask design, fabrication, and experimental ghost imaging applications for patterned X-ray illumination*](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.495024) with [Alaleh Aminzadeh](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=2927), [Benjamin Young](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=1150) and [Cheng-I Chiang](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=3077) (ANU), [Imants Svalbe](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/imants-svalbe) and [David Paganin](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/physics/research/research-areas?a=64532) (Monash University) and [Andrew Kingston](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=67) (ANU) has been accepted by Optics Express.
- (Jun-23) I will be speaking about [hypergradient estimation for bilevel optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04764) at [SIAM Conference on Optimization](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/op23) in Seattle, and am co-organising a series of minisymposia on derivative-free optimization with [Clément Royer](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~croyer/) (Université Paris Dauphine-PSL), [Warren Hare](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/warren-hare/) (UBC) and [Sébastien Le Digabel](https://www.gerad.ca/Sebastien.Le.Digabel/) (Polytechnique Montréal).
