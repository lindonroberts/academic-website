I am a lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.

**Recent news:**

- (Jul-22) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at the ARC OPTIMA training centre seminar series. Details including Zoom information [here](https://optima.org.au/events/optima-seminar-series-27-jul-2022/). Update: watch the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW7a0vVgatw).
- (Jul-22) I am excited to have started a new position as a lecturer in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/) at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). 
- (Jun-22) Our paper *Scalable Subspace Methods for Derivative-Free Nonlinear Least-Squares Optimization* with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) (University of Oxford) has been published in Mathematical Programming. Read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-022-01836-1).
- (Apr-22) New paper out, *Direct search based on probabilistic descent in reduced spaces* with [Clément Royer](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~croyer/) (Université Paris Dauphine-PSL), showing how using randomized subspaces can make direct search methods more efficient at scale. Read it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01275).
- (Feb-22) Some thoughts I have about giving research seminars are now available on the [ANU MSI website](https://maths.anu.edu.au/files/talk-advice.pdf). They are based on mine and [Pierre Portal's](https://sites.google.com/view/pierre-portal/home) experiences and are aimed at students in any area of mathematics. Of course, they are just our opinions and shouldn't be taken as definitive!
- (Dec-21) Our paper *Does Model Calibration Reduce Uncertainty in Climate Projections?*, led by [Simon Tett](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-tett) (University of Edinburgh) has been accepted to the Journal of Climate. Read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0434.1), or my brief summary for mathematicians [here]({{< ref "publication/climate-calibration-uncertainty/index.md" >}}).
- (Dec-21) I will be speaking about [convex-constrained DFO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05443) at [WoMBaT](https://wombat.mocao.org/) and [AustMS 2021](https://austms.org.au/event/austms-2021/).
- (Nov-21) I am lead organizer for the [Workshop on the Intersections of Computation and Optimisation](https://maths.anu.edu.au/news-events/events/workshop-intersections-computation-and-optimisations) on 22-25 November at ANU. This is the first such workshop, a new initiative of the AustMS special interest group [MoCaO](https://www.mocao.org/). 
- (Nov-21) New paper out, *Model-Based Derivative-Free Methods for Convex-Constrained Optimization* with [Matthew Hough](https://hough.tv/) (University of Waterloo), where we show how use interpolation in general convex sets to do model-based derivative-free optimization. Read it [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05443), and download the new version 1.3 of [DFO-LS](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols) which can now solve problems with general convex constraints!
- (Oct-21) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at the [INFORMS Annual Meeting](https://www.informs.org/Meetings-Conferences/INFORMS-Conference-Calendar/2021-INFORMS-Annual-Meeting), as well as organising two sessions on DFO.
- (Oct-21) I will be speaking about bilevel learning at the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) seminar at Université Paris Dauphine-PSL.
- (Sep-21) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at the University of Leicester's CSE Mathematics Seminar.
