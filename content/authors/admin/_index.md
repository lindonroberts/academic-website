I am an MSI Fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Institute, Australian National University. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.

**Recent news:**

- (Oct-21) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at the [INFORMS Annual Meeting](https://www.informs.org/Meetings-Conferences/INFORMS-Conference-Calendar/2021-INFORMS-Annual-Meeting), as well as organising two sessions on DFO.
- (Oct-21) I will be speaking about bilevel learning at the [Machine Intelligence and Learning Systems](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/) seminar at Universit√© Paris Dauphine-PSL.
- (Sep-21) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at the University of Leicester's CSE Mathematics Seminar.
- (Jul-21) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO at [EUROPT](https://europt2021.sciencesconf.org/), [EURO](https://euro2021athens.com/) and [SIOPT](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/op21).
- (Jul-21) Interviewed by Channel 9 National News about projections for Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout: [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CHHjuBWOXs)
- (Jun-21) Delighted to be announced as the first prize winner of the [20th IMA Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis](https://ima.org.uk/awards-medals/ima-leslie-fox-prize-numerical-analysis/) for my recent paper on [scalable DFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016)! Watch the video of my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS2QBTwR8-4).
- (Jun-21) New paper submitted, *Does Model Calibration Reduce Uncertainty in Climate Projections?*, led by [Simon Tett](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-tett) (University of Edinburgh). The study shows that performing structured parameter tuning of climate models helps to significantly reduce the uncertainties in their predictions. It also shows that my [DFO-LS](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols) code is an effective solver for parameter fitting of climate models. Preprint coming soon!
- (May-21) Very happy to be shortlisted for the [IMA Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis](https://ima.org.uk/awards-medals/ima-leslie-fox-prize-numerical-analysis/) for my recent paper on [scalable DFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016). I will be talking about my work at the [Fox Prize event on 21 June](https://ima.org.uk/16899/20th-ima-leslie-fox-prize-event/).
- (Apr-21) Excited to be interviewed by Channel 9 National News about the progress of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout: [1 April](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OfWOTrvRFHg) and [16 April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puN9aKbcvys).
- (Mar-21) I will be speaking about bilevel learning at [SIAM CSE](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/cse21).
- (Feb-21) New paper [Scalable Subspace Methods for Derivative-Free Nonlinear Least-Squares Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016) with with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) (University of Oxford). This introduces a general framework for derivative-free optimization in random subspaces and specializes it to nonlinear least-squares problems (with an [efficient implementation](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn)).
