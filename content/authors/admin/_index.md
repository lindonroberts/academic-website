I am an MSI Fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Institute, Australian National University. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.

**Recent news:**

- (Apr-21) Excited to be interviewed by Channel 9 National News about the progress of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout. [Watch the video here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OfWOTrvRFHg&feature=share).
- (Mar-21) I will be speaking about bilevel learning at [SIAM CSE](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/cse21).
- (Feb-21) New paper [Scalable Subspace Methods for Derivative-Free Nonlinear Least-Squares Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016) with with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) (University of Oxford). This introduces a general framework for derivative-free optimization in random subspaces and specializes it to nonlinear least-squares problems (with an [efficient implementation](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn)). 
- (Jan-21) My paper [Escaping local minima with local derivative-free methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11343) with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) and [Oliver Sheridan-Methven](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/oliver.sheridan-methven) (University of Oxford) has been accepted by [Optimization](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/gopt20/current).
- (Dec-20) My paper [Inexact Derivative-Free Optimization for Bilevel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12674) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) has been accepted by the [Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision](https://www.springer.com/journal/10851).
- (Dec-20) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO methods at both [WoMBaT](https://wombat.mocao.org/) and the optimization stream of [AustMS](https://austms.org.au/meetings/annual-conferences/2020-austms-meeting/). 
- (Nov-20) New paper [Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning with Dynamic Accuracy Derivative-Free Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03151) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) has been accepted for the [OPT2020 workshop](http://www.opt-ml.org/) at NeurIPS 2020. We introduce an efficient hyperparameter tuning algorithm with convergence guarantees.
- (Oct-20) I'm delighted to receive the Reddick Prize from the [InFoMM CDT](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/industrially-focused-mathematical-modelling-epsrc-cdt) at the University of Oxford for my doctoral research! Read more [here](https://maths.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/lindon-roberts-awarded-prestigious-reddick-prize-university-oxford).
- (Oct-20) New software package [DFBGN](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn) is now available. It solves large-scale nonlinear least-squares problems without derivatives.
