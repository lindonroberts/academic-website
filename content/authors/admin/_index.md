I am an MSI Fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Institute, Australian National University. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.

**Recent news:**

- (Dec-20) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO methods at both [WoMBaT](https://wombat.mocao.org/) and the optimization stream of [AustMS](https://austms.org.au/meetings/annual-conferences/2020-austms-meeting/). 
- (Nov-20) New paper [Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning with Dynamic Accuracy Derivative-Free Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03151) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) has been accepted for the [OPT2020 workshop](http://www.opt-ml.org/) at NeurIPS 2020. We introduce an efficient hyperparameter tuning algorithm with convergence guarantees.
- (Oct-20) I'm delighted to receive the Reddick Prize from the [InFoMM CDT](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/industrially-focused-mathematical-modelling-epsrc-cdt) at the University of Oxford for my doctoral research!
- (Oct-20) New software package [DFBGN](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn) is now available. It solves large-scale nonlinear least-squares problems without derivatives. 
- (Jun-20) New paper [Scalable Derivative-Free Optimization for Nonlinear Least-Squares Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13243) with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) and Tyler Ferguson (Oxford) has been accepted for the ICML workshop [Beyond First-Order Methods in ML Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/optml-icml2020/accepted-papers).
- (Jun-20) New paper [Inexact Derivative-Free Optimization for Bilevel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12674) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath). We introduce a new algorithm for learning variational regularization parameters, applicable to problems such as image denoising and MRI reconstruction.
