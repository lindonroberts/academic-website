I am an MSI Fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Institute, Australian National University. My research interests are in numerical analysis and data science, particularly nonconvex and derivative-free optimization. 

Details of my CV, publications, talks and software are below (or look at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=s8Xj5BgAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/lindonroberts)). For general optimization resources, see below or my [nonlinear optimization resources](opt/) page.

**Recent news:**

- (Jun-21) Delighted to be announced as the first prize winner of the [20th IMA Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis](https://ima.org.uk/awards-medals/ima-leslie-fox-prize-numerical-analysis/) for my recent paper on [scalable DFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016)!
- (Jun-21) New paper submitted, *Does Model Calibration Reduce Uncertainty in Climate Projections?*, led by [Simon Tett](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-tett) (University of Edinburgh). The study shows that performing structured parameter tuning of climate models helps to significantly reduce the uncertainties in their predictions. It also shows that my [DFO-LS](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols) code is an effective solver for parameter fitting of climate models. Preprint coming soon!
- (May-21) Very happy to be shortlisted for the [IMA Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis](https://ima.org.uk/awards-medals/ima-leslie-fox-prize-numerical-analysis/) for my recent paper on [scalable DFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016). I will be talking about my work at the [Fox Prize event on 21 June](https://ima.org.uk/16899/20th-ima-leslie-fox-prize-event/).
- (Apr-21) Excited to be interviewed by Channel 9 National News about the progress of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout: [1 April](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OfWOTrvRFHg) and [16 April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puN9aKbcvys).
- (Mar-21) I will be speaking about bilevel learning at [SIAM CSE](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/cse21).
- (Feb-21) New paper [Scalable Subspace Methods for Derivative-Free Nonlinear Least-Squares Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12016) with with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) (University of Oxford). This introduces a general framework for derivative-free optimization in random subspaces and specializes it to nonlinear least-squares problems (with an [efficient implementation](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn)). 
- (Jan-21) My paper [Escaping local minima with local derivative-free methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11343) with [Coralia Cartis](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cartis/) and [Oliver Sheridan-Methven](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/oliver.sheridan-methven) (University of Oxford) has been accepted by [Optimization](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/gopt20/current).
- (Dec-20) My paper [Inexact Derivative-Free Optimization for Bilevel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12674) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) has been accepted by the [Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision](https://www.springer.com/journal/10851).
- (Dec-20) I will be speaking about large-scale DFO methods at both [WoMBaT](https://wombat.mocao.org/) and the optimization stream of [AustMS](https://austms.org.au/meetings/annual-conferences/2020-austms-meeting/). 
- (Nov-20) New paper [Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning with Dynamic Accuracy Derivative-Free Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03151) with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/) (University of Bath) has been accepted for the [OPT2020 workshop](http://www.opt-ml.org/) at NeurIPS 2020. We introduce an efficient hyperparameter tuning algorithm with convergence guarantees.
