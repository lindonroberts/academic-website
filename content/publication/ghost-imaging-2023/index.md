abstract: "A set of non-configurable transversely-displaced masks has been designed and fabricated to generate high-quality X-ray illumination patterns for use in imaging technique such as ghost imaging (GI), ghost projection, and speckle tracking. The designs include a range of random binary and orthogonal patterns, fabricated through a combination of photolithography and gold electroplating techniques. We experimentally demonstrated that a single wafer can be used as an illumination mask for GI, employing individual illumination patterns and also a mixture of patterns, using a laboratory X-ray source. The quality of the reconstructed X-ray ghost images have been characterized and evaluated through a range of metrics."
