abstract: "We present a method to shape a neutron beam and project any specified target image using a single universal patterned mask that is transversely displaced. The method relies on 'ghost projection,' which is a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. A set of submask regions that combine to construct the required beam shape is computed; illumination of each region with the determined exposure time projects the shaped beam. We demonstrate this method experimentally, using the Dingo neutron imaging beamline at the OPAL nuclear research reactor (Australia). The ability to shape a neutron beam 'on demand' allows selective dose delivery away from sensitive areas of samples, such as in cultural heritage artifacts. It also benefits irradiation techniques, e.g., in testing the resilience of electronic components for space and defense technologies or neutron therapies."
