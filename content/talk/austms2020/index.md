summary:
abstract: "Derivative-free optimisation (DFO) methods are an important class of optimisation routines with applications in areas such as in image analysis and data science. However, in model-based DFO methods, the computational cost of constructing local models can be high. As a result, these algorithms are not as suitable for large-scale problems as derivative-based methods. In this talk, I will introduce a derivative-free method based on exploration of random subspaces, suitable for nonlinear least-squares problems. This method has a substantially reduced computational cost (in terms of linear algebra), while still making progress using few objective evaluations."
