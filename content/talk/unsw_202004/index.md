summary:
abstract: "Least-squares problems (such as parameter estimation) are ubiquitous across quantitative disciplines. Optimisation algorithms for solving such problems are numerous and well-established. However, in cases where models are computationally expensive, black box, or noisy, classical algorithms can be impractical or even fail. Derivative-free optimisation (DFO) methods provide an alternative approach which can handle these settings. In this talk, Lindon will introduce a derivative-free version of the classical Gauss-Newton method, discuss its theoretical guarantees and software implementation, and describe applications of this technique to parameter estimation of global climate models and image reconstruction."
